# What is this project about?

<p>This project was made in order to fill the requirements of the Linear and Geometric Algebra class in ITB Informatics Engineering. This project consists of several features, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linear Equation Calculator</li>
    <li>Determinant Calculator</li>
    <li>Matrix Inverse Calculator</li>
    <li>Polynomial Interpolation Calculator</li>
    <li>Bilinear Regression Calculator</li>
</ul>
<p>FYI : All those features above can read and write test cases either in file or in console.
    
# The Creation Process
This program was made under several conditions:
* Using Java SE Runtime Environment (build 15+36-1562). (JDK & JRE)
* Created using Visual Studio Code with several extensions.


# How do you run this program?
## Using batch file
Run `run.bat` once, it will automatically compile and run the java files.


## Manually compile using `javac` and running using `java`
1. Firstly, make sure you're in `src` directory right now, if not, try to change your directory by typing `cd srcPATH` in your command line. `srcPATH` is the path where you store the `src` file which included in `Algeo01-13519044` folder.
2. Type in into command line : `javac -d ../bin ./*.java`, it will compile all `.java` files i.e create the bytecodes.
3. Finally, to interpret `Main` bytecode i.e run the program, type in into command line : `java -cp ../bin Main`.
